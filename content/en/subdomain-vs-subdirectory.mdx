When adding a blog to your website, a seemingly simple question arises: should it live at `blog.example.com` (subdomain) or `example.com/blog` (subdirectory)?

This decision affects your site's SEO performance, management complexity, and long-term content strategy. Let's dive deep into the differences between these two approaches and how to make the right choice.

## Technical Definitions

Before we begin, let's clarify these two concepts:

**Subdomain**: A prefix added before the main domain, forming an independent third-level domain.

```
blog.example.com
shop.example.com
docs.example.com
```

**Subdirectory**: A path added after the main domain, with content hosted under the same domain.

```
example.com/blog
example.com/shop
example.com/docs
```

From a technical architecture standpoint, subdomains can point to completely different servers, while subdirectories typically reside on the same server. This distinction significantly impacts how search engines understand and process your content.

## Google's Official Position

Google Search Advocate John Mueller has publicly stated multiple times:

> "In general, we see these the same. I would personally try to keep things together as much as possible."

In another response, he elaborated:

> "Google Web Search is fine with using either subdomains or subdirectories... use what works best for your setup and think about your longer-term plans when picking one or the other."

Google's official stance is clear: **from a technical perspective, their search algorithm can process both structures equally**. However, it's worth noting that even Google's official representative personally leans toward recommending subdirectories.

## Industry Experts' Different Views

Despite Google's claim that both are equivalent, the SEO community's practical experience tells a different story.

Several prominent SEO experts have shared their perspectives:

- **Gianluca Fiorelli** (MOZ/I Love SEO): Subdirectories are the best choice because authority is more concentrated
- **Stephen Kenwright** (Branded3): Subdirectories are almost always better than subdomains
- **Eric Enge** (Stone Temple): Recommends subdirectories for new sites; not worth migrating existing subdomains just for SEO

### Real-World Case Studies

Here are some publicly documented migration cases:

| Case          | Change                    | Result                           |
| ------------- | ------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Chubo Knives  | Subdomain → Subdirectory  | +421% organic traffic            |
| Monster.co.uk | Subdomain → Subdirectory  | +116% search visibility          |
| HotPads       | blog.hotpads.com → /blog/ | Traffic doubled                  |
| Flick         | Subdomain → Subdirectory  | 9.6M annual traffic in 12 months |

Of course, there are also failed cases. IWantMyName once migrated from subdirectory to subdomain, resulting in a significant traffic drop and forcing them to migrate back.

  optimization measures, such as platform restructuring, internal link
  improvements, and fixing technical issues. A structural migration alone
  doesn't guarantee the same results.

## Technical Analysis

Why do subdirectories tend to perform better in practice? Let's analyze from a technical perspective.

### Domain Authority Transfer

Subdirectories naturally inherit all authority from the main domain. When someone links to `example.com/blog/article`, that backlink directly strengthens the entire `example.com` domain.

Subdomains, however, are treated by search engines as semi-independent entities. Links pointing to `blog.example.com` primarily accumulate value for the subdomain itself, with more indirect contribution to the main domain.

### Internal Link Value

- **Subdirectories**: All internal links are true internal links, with smooth authority transfer
- **Subdomains**: Links between subdomains may be treated as "external links," diluting authority transfer

### Crawler Behavior Differences

John Mueller explained the differences in Google's crawler behavior:

> Subdirectories help us crawl because we know all the content is on the same server and can crawl it similarly.
>
> Subdomains work for us too... but we need to learn to crawl them separately, which is mainly a formality for the first few days.

While it's only a "few days" issue, for new sites or new content, this learning period may affect indexing speed.

### Management Convenience

With subdirectories, you only need:

- One SSL certificate
- One analytics configuration (Google Analytics / Search Console)
- One hosting environment

Subdomains may require separate configurations for each of these, increasing operational overhead.

## How to Choose?

### Scenarios Where Subdirectories Are Recommended

| Scenario                         | Reason                                       |
| -------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| Blogs                            | Share main site authority, boost overall SEO |
| Product pages                    | Unified branding, simplified management      |
| Resource centers/Knowledge bases | Maximize internal link benefits              |
| New sites                        | More efficient to concentrate authority      |

### Scenarios Where Subdomains Are Appropriate

| Scenario                            | Reason                                    |
| ----------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| International sites                 | es.example.com, fr.example.com            |
| Standalone apps/tools               | app.example.com needs separate deployment |
| Completely different business lines | Brand separation required                 |
| Development/Testing environments    | staging.example.com                       |
| Technical architecture constraints  | Cannot host under main domain             |

## CitePo's Recommendation

As a [blogging platform optimized for both SEO and GEO](/en/why-choose-citepo-to-build-blog), CitePo supports both deployment methods:

**If you already have a website**, we strongly recommend subdirectory deployment (e.g., `example.com/blog`). Your blog content will directly build authority for your main domain—this is the core value of content marketing.

**If it's a brand new standalone blog**, subdomains are also a reasonable choice. In this case, you can use a structure like `blog.yourname.com`.

In CitePo's domain settings, you can freely choose between these two methods, with the most cost-effective pricing:

> - Adding a domain is free
> - Simply subscribe to the Pro plan to add subdirectories—no need to pay extra or subscribe to an enterprise plan like other blogging platforms

The setup process takes just a few minutes, and you'll receive the same high-quality hosting service regardless of which method you choose.

## Summary

Let's recap the key points:

1. **Google officially** claims both are technically equivalent
2. **SEO practice** generally shows subdirectories perform better
3. **Technical reasons** include authority inheritance, internal link benefits, and management convenience
4. **In most scenarios**, subdirectories are the safer choice
5. **In specific scenarios** (internationalization, standalone apps), subdomains are more appropriate

If you're adding a blog to your website, subdirectories are our recommended default choice. This is not only an SEO best practice but also the simplest technical solution.
