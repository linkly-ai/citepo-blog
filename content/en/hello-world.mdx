Welcome to your brand new blog! This is a sample post generated by [CitePo](https://citepo.com) to help you get started.

## What is CitePo?

CitePo is a lightweight blog publishing platform. You write posts in **MDX** (Markdown + JSX), push to Git, and your site is built and deployed automatically.

MDX lets you use rich components inside Markdown. This post itself is an MDX file — scroll down to the "MDX Components" section to see what's available!
</Callout>

## Writing Your First Real Post

Create a new `.mdx` file in the `content/` directory. Every post needs **frontmatter** at the top:

```mdx
