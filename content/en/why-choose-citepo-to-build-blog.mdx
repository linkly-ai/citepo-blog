If you're a developer or running an AI startup, you know the struggle: you want a blog to share updates, build authority, and drive organic traffic — but setting one up shouldn't feel like building another product.

That's exactly why CitePo exists.

## The Problem with Existing Solutions

### WordPress / Ghost

Full-featured CMS platforms are powerful, but they come with baggage:

- **Hosting headaches** — you need a server, database, and ongoing maintenance
- **Security concerns** — constant updates and vulnerability patches
- **Overkill for most blogs** — you just want to publish markdown, not manage a CMS

<Callout type="warning">
Traditional CMS platforms require ongoing server maintenance and security patching — effort that should be spent on writing content.
</Callout>

### Static Site Generators (Hugo, Jekyll, Gatsby)

These are closer to what developers want, but still have friction:

- **Complex configuration** — themes, plugins, build pipelines
- **Heavy dependency trees** — hundreds of packages, frequent breakage
- **Your repo is 90% engine** — the actual content is buried under framework code

<Callout type="warning">
With SSGs, you end up maintaining a complex build system instead of focusing on your content.
</Callout>

### Medium / Substack

Easy to start, but:

- **No ownership** — your content lives on someone else's platform
- **Limited branding** — you look like every other blog on the platform
- **SEO limitations** — you're building their domain authority, not yours

<Callout type="warning">
Hosted platforms trade convenience for control — your content, your brand, and your SEO all belong to someone else.
</Callout>
